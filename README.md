# APOS-Automatic-Process-optimization-system
This project was deisgned to take an old process reporting system and bring it into the the modern age, with real-time feedback on process performance and quality.  This application reads raw text file reports produced by the system and converts them into digital data stored in a database for a fully featured diagnostics system.
