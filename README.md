# APOS-Automatic Process Optimization System

This project was deisgned to take an old process reporting system and bring it into the the modern age, with real-time feedback on process performance and quality.  

This application reads raw text file reports produced by the system and converts them into digital data stored in a database for a fully featured diagnostics system.

### Please note some features have been removed. It has also been changed to store the data in memory rather than a database to save any setting up.

Download test report files here. (in the software you upload them under settings - upload new batch reports
