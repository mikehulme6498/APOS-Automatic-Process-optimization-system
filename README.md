# APOS - Automatic process optimization system
This project was designed to take an old process reporting system that creates raw text files as its reports and bring it into the modern age, with real-time feedback on process performance and quality.  

This application reads the text file reports produced by the system and converts them into digital data stored in a database for a fully-featured diagnostics system.

## Program Usage

If you wish to use the program please note I have removed some features due to sensitivity. I have also chnaged the program to store data in memory rather than a database
to make it easier for you to use.

You can download demo batch reports to put into the system here

Once you have the program running you can upload them by going into settings - Upload new batch reports

## Side Note

The repository I am working on is private, I have modified the program to remove sensitive data and created this public repo for it. It appears there are no commits but as you can see for the snapshot below there are plenty of commits in the working repo.
